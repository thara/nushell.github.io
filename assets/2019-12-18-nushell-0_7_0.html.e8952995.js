To use it, use <code>&lt;number&gt;..&lt;number&gt;</code>. Currently, you can use it with the new <code>range</code> command, which lets you do commands like:</p><div class="language-text ext-text"><pre class="language-text"><code>ls | range 3..5
</code></pre></div><p>And return rows 3 through 5 of the table that <code>ls</code> gives you.</p><h1 id="autocomplete-improvements-jonathandturner" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#autocomplete-improvements-jonathandturner" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Autocomplete improvements (jonathandturner)</h1><p>As we improve the parser, we are getting more opportunities to do more with the results. One feature we added recently is the ability to autocomplete flags for internal commands.</p><p>For example, if you want to see what&#39;s available for the <code>config</code> command, you can now type <code>config --</code> and then immediately use the <code>&lt;tab&gt;</code> key to cycle through possible options.</p><h1 id="nu-becomes-multiple-crates-wycats-jonathandturner" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#nu-becomes-multiple-crates-wycats-jonathandturner" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Nu becomes multiple crates (wycats, jonathandturner)</h1><p>Part of a big effort to get Nu ready for script support is to refactor the current codebase to make it cleaner and easier to work with.</p><p>For the last few weeks, a big part of this refactor involved splitting our growing monolith of a codebase into separate sub-crates that work together to give the same functionality. As we&#39;ve done so, we&#39;ve been able to clean up some of the interfaces between the code. The end result is something that already is easier to work with, and we&#39;re excited about what this means for future development.</p><p>One side effect of this work is that we&#39;ve now separated out the plugins from the main <code>nu</code> crate. This gives you more options to configure your Nu setup how you want, as each optional crate can be separately installed.</p><p>From cargo, you can install the main crate with:</p><div class="language-text ext-text"><pre class="language-text"><code>cargo install nu
</code></pre></div><p>Then, you can install the plugins the same way. You can find them because they have a name starting with <code>nu_plugin_</code>. For example, to install the textview plugin:</p><div class="language-text ext-text"><pre class="language-text"><code>cargo install nu_plugin_textview
</code></pre></div><p>The current set of plugins includes:</p><ul><li>nu_plugin_average</li><li>nu_plugin_binaryview</li><li>nu_plugin_fetch</li><li>nu_plugin_inc</li><li>nu_plugin_match</li><li>nu_plugin_post</li><li>nu_plugin_ps</li><li>nu_plugin_str</li><li>nu_plugin_sum</li><li>nu_plugin_sys</li><li>nu_plugin_textview</li><li>nu_plugin_tree</li></ul><p>By default, Nu will install a small set of these plugins (&quot;sys&quot;, &quot;ps&quot;, &quot;textview&quot;, &quot;inc&quot;, &quot;str&quot;). You can optionally turn this off using:</p><div class="language-text ext-text"><pre class="language-text"><code>cargo install nu --no-default-features
</code></pre></div><h1 id="introducing-stable-and-unstable-features" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#introducing-stable-and-unstable-features" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Introducing: stable and unstable features</h1><p>Another part of the current refactor work is that we&#39;re splitting the &quot;stable&quot; and &quot;unstable&quot; features up. This lets us experiment a bit easier before a command becomes a stable part of the releases.</p><p>Now, to install all the stable features, you can use:</p><div class="language-text ext-text"><pre class="language-text"><code>cargo install nu --features=stable
</code></pre></div><p>If you want to get both stable <em>and</em> unstable features, use:</p><div class="language-text ext-text"><pre class="language-text"><code>cargo install nu --all-features
</code></pre></div><p>Warning: unless you&#39;re working on Nu itself you may not want to install all features currently, as you&#39;ll see that we&#39;re working on an internal tracing tool.</p><h1 id="moving-the-book-s-sebastian-xyz" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#moving-the-book-s-sebastian-xyz" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Moving the book(s) (sebastian-xyz)</h1><p>We&#39;ve been hard at working building up the websites.
