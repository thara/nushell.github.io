Shell types of activities include, but aren&#39;t limited to:</p><ul><li>Running commands</li><li>Redirecting stdout/stdin/stderr</li><li>Unix-only: Properly handling signals <ul><li>Ctrl-C</li><li>Ctrl-D</li><li>and others</li></ul></li><li>Support for background tasks <ul><li>In Unix, this may mean Ctrl-Z and traditional background/foregrounding of tasks or a more modern approach</li></ul></li></ul><p>In cases where the user would reasonably have an expectation of the functionality of the shell, we should make every effort to include. If a feature would be a reasonable expectation (say ctrl-z on Unix), then we should have OS-specific functionality for that platform that meets that expectation.</p><h3 id="scripting-language" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scripting-language" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scripting language</h3><p>The intent of Nushell&#39;s design is to be a scripting language. Scripting can take many forms, from simple pipelines to large scripts. Nushell should handle these with ease by meeting reasonable expectations in terms of:</p><ul><li>Modularity</li><li>Readability</li><li>Programming language features and convenience</li></ul><h3 id="structured-data" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#structured-data" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Structured data</h3><p>In Nushell, all data is &quot;structured&quot;. For Nushell, this means that values can take shapes beyond just a simple string.</p><p>Values in Nushell can be records, lists, tables, binary data, and more. Being able to convert into structured data and work with structured data is fundamental to Nushell.</p><h3 id="pipelines" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#pipelines" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Pipelines</h3><p>Nushell takes the Unix philosophy of pipelines to heart. Commands should be built with the intent of composition. Nushell enables composition via the use of pipes (<code>|</code>), just like Unix pipelines.</p><p>Composing commands, both built-in and user-defined, is a core piece of Nushell. The design of Nushell and its standard library must support both easily composing commands as well as allowing the user to easily create compose-able commands.</p><h3 id="command-philosophy" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#command-philosophy" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Command philosophy</h3><p>Specifically, Nushell&#39;s philosophy about commands is represented by the following positions (these apply especially to the library of builtin commands distributed with nushell, but are also good guidance for your own commands and plugins):</p>',20),u=a('There should be one -- and preferably only one -- obvious way to do it.

In the 0.60 series, these were largely both treated on under the same concept as &quot;blocks&quot;.</p><p>In the future, a block will not be a first-class value.
