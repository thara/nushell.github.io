When Nu doesn&#39;t recognize a command, it will try to find it as an external command. In the last few versions, this was limited as Nu was not able to execute shell scripts, .cmd scripts... basically anything that wasn&#39;t an executable. The problem is that lots of apps use scripts as a way to configure what to execute (commands like <code>code</code>, <code>npm</code>, and others are common scripts behind the scenes).</p><p>With 0.9.0, we&#39;re returning to our earlier behavior and executing both binaries and shell scripts by calling to the platform-native shell when we call an external command. While this should largely be invisible as a user, more things should &quot;just work&quot; how they would in bash or Windows Terminal.</p><h2 id="new-commands" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#new-commands" aria-hidden="true">#</a> New commands</h2><h3 id="du-amanita-muscaria" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#du-amanita-muscaria" aria-hidden="true">#</a> du (Amanita-muscaria)</h3><p>Nu now has its own <code>du</code> command to show the disk usage of a part of the file system.

This is where the implementation showed through a bit more than it should. As tables are printed, they are created and then displayed as enough rows are available. This means that output will spool to the screen and not wait for the table to finish processing before you see something. In general, it&#39;s good to see the tables earlier, but seeing a different shape of table every 50 rows can be annoying.</p><p>We&#39;ve updated table output to be a lot cleaner, using this logic:</p><ul><li>If rows are being output quickly, build a larger table before outputting it</li><li>If rows are being output slowly, buffer a smaller number of rows and display them (just as before)</li><li>If rows change shape, switch to showing a different table. This helps you visually see when your data source is giving you a new kind of data</li></ul><h2 id="command-improvements" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#command-improvements" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Command improvements</h2><h3 id="ls-and-rm-now-error-when-a-path-isn-t-found-amanita-muscaria" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ls-and-rm-now-error-when-a-path-isn-t-found-amanita-muscaria" aria-hidden="true">#</a> <code>ls</code> and <code>rm</code> now error when a path isn&#39;t found (Amanita-muscaria)</h3><p>Adding a bit of polish this release, <code>ls</code> and <code>rm</code> will now error if you pass them a path they can&#39;t find.</p><h3 id="ls-can-optionally-show-just-the-filename-coolshaurya" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ls-can-optionally-show-just-the-filename-coolshaurya" aria-hidden="true">#</a> <code>ls</code> can optionally show just the filename (coolshaurya)</h3><p>If you&#39;ve used <code>ls</code> on your subdirectories, you might have noticed that the subdirectory becomes part of the filename.
