The coloring is just the tip of the iceberg, as it were, and builds from a reworking of the parser to make it more accurate, more stable, and more feature-complete.</p><h2 id="streaming-table-jonathandturner" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#streaming-table-jonathandturner" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Streaming table (jonathandturner)</h2><p><img src="'+d+'" alt="Animation of a long table streaming out"> Streaming tables</p><p>Up to this point, we&#39;ve taken a few shortcuts with how streams worked in Nushell. We knew that a table, in theory, was a stream of rows. In practice, though, this wasn&#39;t the case as the code has lots of assumptions about how tables worked.</p><p>With the 0.4.0, we&#39;re taking a big step in the direction of full support for streams. You&#39;ll see that now data will start being printed as it becomes available, with tables printing pages of 50 rows at a time (by default). This allows you to get deep listings of files (eg using <code>ls **</code>), work with streams from external sources, and more.</p><h2 id="better-ctrl-c-support-jonathandturner-landaire" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#better-ctrl-c-support-jonathandturner-landaire" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Better ctrl-c support (jonathandturner, landaire)</h2><p>As part of having streams of tables, it&#39;s always helpful to be able to say &quot;stop!&quot; when you need to.

Contributer est31 has been hard at work at moving Nu onto stable Rust and has now successfully moved Nu off of nightly and onto beta. As beta matures and becomes the next release of Rust, we&#39;ll be able to move Nu onto stable. This should help people who are working to distribute Nu on various distributions.</p><h2 id="brazilian-portuguese-book-marcelocg" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#brazilian-portuguese-book-marcelocg" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Brazilian Portuguese book (marcelocg)</h2><p>Contributor marcelocg surprised us with a translation of the Nu book into Brazillian Portuguese.
