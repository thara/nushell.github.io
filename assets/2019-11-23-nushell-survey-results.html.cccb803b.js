In our first question, we wanted to see how many folks are using Nu already. Perhaps unsurprising for a project still missing major functionality, most respondents aren&#39;t users, yet. As we&#39;ll see, there are themes around what people are waiting for before they jump in.</p><p>But first, let&#39;s take a look at the responses from folks how are currently using Nu.</p><h1 id="nu-users" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#nu-users" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Nu users</h1><h2 id="what-do-you-like-20-responses" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-do-you-like-20-responses" aria-hidden="true">#</a> What do you like?

People currently using Nushell felt that tables and Nu&#39;s structured approach were their favorite features.</p><p>People also enjoyed the rich support for different file formats that Nu ships with as well as its focus on being cross-platform.</p><p>Other topics mentioned: syntax highlighting, good plugins, shells feature, tags feature, and that it is written in Rust.</p><h3 id="quotes" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#quotes" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Quotes</h3><ul><li><em>&quot;The structured data handling is awesome!&quot;</em></li><li><em>&quot;Tables! \\o/&quot;</em></li><li><em>&quot;It makes it easier to work with data on the command line.

(20 responses)</h2><p><img src="'+d+'" alt="needs work: top ones are autocomplete, shortcuts, tool integration"></p><p>Nu users also pointed out a few areas where they hoped Nu would improve over time. Top of mind were improvements around auto-completion, improving the keyboard shortcuts, and better integration with existing shells and tools.</p><p>There were also a batch of additional improvements people wished for: full scripting support, better examples/documentation, improved stability, interactive table viewing, more commands, smarter table drawing, better coloring, better error messages, aliases, prompt customization, and general performance improvements.</p><h3 id="quotes-1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#quotes-1" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Quotes</h3><ul><li><em>&quot;Better documentation for how to write custom wrappers around existing tools.&quot;</em></li><li><em>&quot;The coloring and autocomplete and a scripting language&quot;</em></li><li><em>&quot;Compatibility with other shells.

(100 responses)</h2><p><img src="'+p+'" alt="blocked adoption: top ones are time and maturity"></p><p>We also asked for feedback from people not using Nu what their thoughts were. What are the kinds of things that block them from using Nu?</p><p>Top of the list are &quot;time&quot; and &quot;maturity&quot;. Many people mentioned that it takes time to learn a new system, and time is a precious resource (don&#39;t we know it!). Maturity also came up for a lot of folks - if it&#39;s not mature yet, the time investment might go to waste. In general, there was a sense of waiting until things are further along before jumping in.</p><p>We also heard from many people who were perfectly comfortable in their current shells, whether it be zsh, bash, or fish.

Similarly to the previous question, &quot;stability&quot; and &quot;time&quot; were at the top of the list.</p><p>Digging in a bit further, it&#39;s not only that Nu itself is changing, but that the package ecosystem hadn&#39;t stayed up-to-date with Nu&#39;s releases, or didn&#39;t yet offer a package. This meant it was easy to not be able to keep up, even if they had time to.</p><p>Other topics that came up: needing better autocomplete, needing aliases, better scripting, support for Windows network drives, and improved documentation.</p><h3 id="quotes-3" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#quotes-3" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Quotes</h3><ul><li><em>&quot;It was interesting, but I have a pretty significant ecosystem built around my flows in Bash and Zsh I can&#39;t give up just yet.

Lots of it. We wanted to take a moment to appreciate everyone who sent us kind notes to keep going, that they loved what we were building and were excited to try it in the future, and how much they loved the concept.
